Assignment #1: Local Variable Value Tracer


Your submission must satisfy the following requirements:

* R1. Shall initialize your assignment repository from https://classroom.github.com/a/dVoUv6LC
* R2. Write your `LVVTracer.py` in the repository.
* R3. Test your `LVVTracer.py` by using `pytest`.
* R4. Your repository name should be `{student_id}-LVVTracer`.
* R5. `LVVTracer` class should be defined in the `LVVTracer.py`
* R6. The above class is tested as:

```
from LVVTracer import LVVTracer

def test_lvv_sha256():
    with LVVTracer(target_func = "target_function") as traced:
        target_function(args)
```

* R7. LVVTracer should count the number of value changes for each local variables in “target_function()”.
* R8. There is a member function called “getLVVmap()” in LVVTracer, which returns a dictionary of {“var1”: change_count1, “var2”: change_count2, …}.  LVVTracer should count the changes of local variables ONLY in “target_function()”.



Note:

* N1. `pytest` (based on `test_lvv1.py`) is just for validating your program. The final grading will be made by other test cases.
* N2. Submissions via GitHub Classroom will only be accepted. Submissions via LMS are not accepted.
